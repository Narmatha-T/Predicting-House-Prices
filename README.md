# Predicting-House-Prices
Linear Regression to Predict House Prices using Turicreate.
Here we can either use graphlab or turicreate framework.
Turi Create simplifies the development of custom machine learning models. You don't have to be a machine learning expert to add recommendations, object detection, image classification, image similarity or activity classification to your app. So we use Turicrete here.

In this notebook we will use data on house sales in King County to predict house prices using simple (one input) linear regression.

- Use graphlab SArray and SFrame functions to compute important summary statistics 
- Write a function to compute the Simple Linear Regression weights using the closed form solution 
- Write a function to make predictions of the output given the input feature 
- Turn the regression around to predict the input given the output 
- Compare two different models for predicting house prices

By the end we will be able to predict house prices from a given set of data and features.
