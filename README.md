# Predicting-House-Prices
Linear Regression to Predict House Prices using Turicreate.
Here we can either use graphlab or turicreate framework.
Turi Create simplifies the development of custom machine learning models. You don't have to be a machine learning expert to add recommendations, object detection, image classification, image similarity or activity classification to your app. So we use Turicrete here.

By the end we will be able to predict house prices from a given set of data and features.
